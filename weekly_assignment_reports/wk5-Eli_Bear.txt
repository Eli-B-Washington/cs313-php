3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.

So I am able to access different parts of the database and display those for the user. 
 Test data was put into the database so that there is information that is retrievable.


4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.

Still need to add in the sections that have a want to play list and a have played list. Also need to fix the search games bar so that
it is able to search a game by title.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

I liked putting together making the database and retrieving the information.

6. Why should you create a separate user account for your application to access the database?

I didn't really do this but this would help with security and making sure unauthorized users do not update or change data accidentally.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but significantly deficient  - This one
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

The database is connected to the application but work still needs to be done to retrieve the correct information on each page.
