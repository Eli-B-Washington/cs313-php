So I am able to get the information posted to PHP but I still need a way to add information to the database.  I am not too worried about it I just need to find the right command.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working
correctly.
Not able to Add, update, or delete yet from the application. So still need to do everything from this week.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this

Well I really liked doing the team assignment and seeing the components of updating the information in action.

6. What is a benefit of having a foreign key constraint?
A foreign Key constraint can help so that data isn’t inserted where it shouldn’t be.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but significantly deficient – Here.
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements
8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I think it is closer to being where it should than it looks.  I just need to find out what statement I using incorrectly to insert.  Updating and deleting should fall along the same lines.
